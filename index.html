	<h2>Time as an Inventor</h2>
	<p>In 2005 Martin Luevano invented the world changing product known as the snuggie. Finding major success with this
		Martin spent the next several years in his workshop creating the next evolution in personal fitness. After thousands
		of hours and hundreds of prototypes the shake-weight was born. The success wouldn't last long though, Martin lost his
		vast wealth on a long shot bet on the results of the 2010 Lincoln, Nebraska city council elections. In 2014 Martin
		has set out to learn the skills necessary to build a website for his next revolutionary product, Kitten Mittens,
		never hear your cats loud feet ever again.
